# Weather Forecast with Redux

Single Page App which displays a five-day weather forecast for desired cities. User can search for a city, optionally choose a country (there are 17 cities named Belgrade in the world) and add it to the list of previous searches. Each list item displays city name, population, static Google map, and expected temperatures, pressure and humidity. Map zoom is defined by the size of the city. Errors are caught in the action creator.
